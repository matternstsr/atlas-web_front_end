// 8. Stack order in functions
// Write a function processPayment:
// It takes one argument amount (number)
// It logs to the console Collecting payment of <amount>
// Write a function named processOrder:
// It takes two arguments orderId (number), and amount (number)
// It logs to the console <orderId> is being processed
// It calls the function processPayment
// It logs to the console <orderId> has been fully processed
// In the main part of the code:
// Logs to the console Processing orders
// Call processOrder with 12321 and 10.99
// Call processOrder with 12322 and 12.99
// Call processOrder with 12323 and 15.0
// Logs to the console All the orders have been processed
// Requirements:
// Your code should log the following to the console
// Processing orders
// 12321 is being processed
// Collecting payment of 10.99
// 12321 has been fully processed
// 12322 is being processed
// Collecting payment of 12.99
// 12322 has been fully processed
// 12323 is being processed
// Collecting payment of 15
// 12323 has been fully processed
// All the orders have been processed

//Prime numbers & timing execution
